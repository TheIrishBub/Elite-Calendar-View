    <h1>About TheIrishBub</h1>

    <p>Prior to October 20th, 2019, all my runs were played and recorded using an
    S-video to HDMI converter on an HDTV, captured by an Elgato HD60.</p>

    <p>Since then, my runs are played on a CRT, and captured using a GV-USB2.</p>

    <p>Huge shout-outs to josh116pep for getting a CRT for me!</p>

    <p>My current project is to fill in my times pages for both GE and PD with
    video proof, no matter how bad the times may be.</p>

    <p>Dual Blazer (420th time rank in both games): 3/24/20 - 3/26/20, 3/26/20 - 3/28/20</p>
